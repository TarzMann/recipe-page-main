## My process

I started setting out the html and content and then moved on to setting the styles with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I used this exercise to refresh my memory on basic HTML and CSS.

I did a lot more learning about mobile first and responsive website design.

My main learning was how to adjust default list items (ordered and unordered).

### Continued development

I realise that I didn't quite set this site up as mobile first, but I will do so for future projects.

I will continue to try and use more complex responsive design using varying column widths for various media types.

I struggled to get a smooth transition of the image at the top of the page from margin to no margin on smaller devices, so I would like to look into this further. Very interested to see other examples to see if anyone managed to find a good solution for this.

I am also still aware that I may not quite understand the cascading nature of stylesheets in-depth yet. Like, should I put all my standard html css changes in first then move onto all the classes... and where is the best place to put the @media query? I put it at the end, but am re-thinkig this may be better at the start.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Responsive section on W3Schools](using https://W3Schools.com) - This helped me to understand some simple and effective basic responsive styling (from scratch).
